- use eng or chinese to note?
	- use english is sometimes good is cuz its faster to type then chinese and it can keep my mind keep thiniking, this is a good thing.
	- but english (also Chinese can have s.t.) is you will note down what you don't really know.

cache error -> due to test case is not think thru, or lazy to skip obvious cache logic and this is where I made the stupid mistake
- lesson? 
- deon't skip the obvious simple test -> which may have blind spot and if you write it wrong, you got a stupid mistake
- the mistake happen when you later move the code, and since you don't have stupid test in place, you break the code
