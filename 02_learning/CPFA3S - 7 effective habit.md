## h1 choice

as is: this is just the way things are and there's not much I can do abt it
to be: I have the power to choose my response

practice

- pause and response
- focus on your circle of influence
- use proactive lang

circle of control
you focus within this circle → circle get bigger
you focus outside circle  → circle get smaller

it's awareness, take practice

## h2 purpose

as is: I go with the flow cuz I can't predict how things will turn out.
to be: clearly defining my vision and purpose will help shape the future I want

what's my personal mission statement? 

an expression to my purpose values and priorities.

## h3 focus

as is: I don't have time, I am too busy
to be: i protect time for what's most important

use urgent-important matrix

## h4 abundant → win win

as is: the more u get, the less there is for me
to be: there's more than enough for everyone

win-win mindset

- principle: abundant
- courage and consideration matrix
    - partner (win-win), steamroller(win-lose), saboteur(lose, lose), doormat(lose win)

## h5 understand then understood

as is: i need to get my points across
to be: to communicate effective w/ you, I need to understand u first

diagnose before prescribe

    - ignoring
    - pretend listening(patronizing)

both feel feeling and understand content

## h6 synergize
